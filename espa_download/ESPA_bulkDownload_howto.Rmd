For bulk download of ESPA files, first run the following in your terminal to clone the bulk down loader:

    git clone https://code.usgs.gov/espa/bulk-downloader.git bulk-downloader
    cd bulk-downloader
    python ./download_espa_order.py -h

Then run this, changing your to your USERNAME (found in the UR corner of your [espa.cr.usgs.gov](https://espa.cr.usgs.gov) site), and pointing to where you want the files downloaded to.

    python ./download_espa_order.py -u USERNAME -d /path/to/file/save}

It will prompt you to enter your password (ers.cr.usgs.gov PW, not EarthData PW), and then will begin the download.

When you've completed your download, you can remove the cloned repo using the following lines in your terminal:

    cd ..
    rm -r bulk-downloader

These are slightly modified directions [from the USGS Code team.](https://code.usgs.gov/espa/bulk-downloader).
