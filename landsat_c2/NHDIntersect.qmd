# Purpose

This script takes a dataframe of latitudinal and longitudinal pairs in the United States to get the associated National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) polygon as well as the polygon metadata from the NHD. This set of polygons can be used to define the Chebyshev centers (Shen, Z., Yu, X., Sheng, Y., Li, J., & Luo, J. (2015). A fast algorithm to estimate the deepest points of lakes for regional lake registration. *PloS one*, *10*(12), e0144700.) using the script CalculateCenter.qmd.
